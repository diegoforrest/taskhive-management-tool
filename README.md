## Incomplete functionality / known issues

- Forgot Password - Through Email authentication
SendGrid API is currently not used/connected. The backend attempts SendGrid when `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is present, but fallback logic (SMTP or returning/logging the reset link in development) is currently the primary path in many environments. Configure `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in `taskhive-backend/.env` and verify SendGrid deliverability to enable full email delivery. Tried testing the api it's not working due to api fallback. (incomplete)

- Caching system, Didn't add caching system on the deployed website that makes the deployed website will load a few seconds. Using CDN to run the website globally will make the website run smoothly probably will add this next time.
